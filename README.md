# FriendFinder

Friend finder is a survey-based compatibility application that matches you with a friend based on your responses.


## Usage

In order to use the app:
1. Navigate to https://peaceful-mountain-92317.herokuapp.com/
2. Click Go to Survey
3. Add your name and a link to your profile image
4. Complete the 10 question survey 
5. Review the best match presented to you 


## How it Works

FriendFinder is an Express application hosted on Heroku. AJAX GET requests are used to handle routing, and GET and POST requests are used for handling user data and calculating compatibility results. The application does not use a database; all user data is stored as objects in a variable within the friends.js file.
